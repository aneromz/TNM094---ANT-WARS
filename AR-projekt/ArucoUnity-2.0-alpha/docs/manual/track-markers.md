# Track Markers

First, make sure you have calibrated your camera: read the [Calibrate a Camera](articles/calibrate-a-camera.html) page. You **need to have a calibration file** to track some aruco objects.

Also, print and place in the environment the aruco objects you want to track. Read the [Create Markers](https://github.com/NormandErwan/ArucoUnity/wiki/1.-Create-Markers) page for details.

To track your aruco objects:

- Open the `Assets/ArucoUnity/Scenes/TrackMarkers.unity` scene.
- Configure the camera:
  1. For a webcam, use the `ArucoWebcamCalibrated` object already in the scene. Otherwise, drag the prefab corresponding to your camera : `Assets/ArucoUnity/Prefabs/Cameras/<CameraType>Calibrated.prefab`.
  2. Fill `CameraParametersFilename` with the camera parameters XML file from the calibration of the camera (*Fig.1*).

- Create each aruco objects to track:
  - Configure it with what you measure on the printed aruco object. Units are in meters for tracking, not in pixels.
  - Use a `ArucoObjectDisplayer` to visualize the aruco object, not a ArucoObjectCreator.
  - Simply add any game object as child of the aruco object e.g. the red cube in *Fig.2*.

*Fig.2: `ArucoMarker` configured to track a physical aruco marker with a 5.4 cm side length. The `ArucoObjectDisplayer` helps to visualize in the editor the physical object that will be tracked.*

- Configure the tracker `ArucoObjectsTracker`:
  1. Drag all the aruco objects to track in `ArucoObjects`.
  2. Set `ArucoCameraDisplay` with the camera prefab you use (*Fig.3*).

- Run the scene! The `ArucoTracker` will place (position, rotation, scale) any detected aruco object in the `ArucoObjects` list relative to the camera (*Fig.4*).
